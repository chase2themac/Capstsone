# Capstsone
This is my first portfolio capstone in which i will be making an app for making requests, and displaying answers.

This is going to be a news app in which you can search the worlds news from thousands of sources all into one site.

For general ease there will not be a source selection, but there will be availible selections from the-
-mandatory "everything" which will grab stories of all sizes and sources, and the "top-headlines" which will obviously pull-
-the most popular stories of said query.

There will also be an optional "catagory" selection in which the user can even specify what type of catagory they wish to search-
-from all the possible catagories the api can do such as "business, entertainment, general, health, science, sports, technology"-
-but of course that is optional.
